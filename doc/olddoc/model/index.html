<h1>
ALPS Project: model library</h1>

The model library contains code for quantum lattice models.
<P>
The library is still in the design and development phase. Documentation will be provided when the interfaces have stabilized. 

<H2>Documentation</H2>
<ul>
<li><B>model.h</B> includes all header files of the model library.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Example</H2>

The easiest way to learn a new library is to study examples
first. We have provided <A HREF="../../example/model/">examples</A>, showing the
most common usage features.
