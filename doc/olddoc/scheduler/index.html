<h1>
ALPS Project: scheduler library</h1>

The scheduler library contains schedulers for parallel Monte Carlo simulations.

<H2>Documentation</H2>
<H3>The header files</h3>
<ul>
<li><B>scheduler.h</B> includes all headers of the scheduler library</li>
<li><A HREF="signal.html"><B>scheduler/signal.hpp</B></A> a signal handler class</li>
<li><B><A HREF="scheduler.html">scheduler/scheduler.h</A></B> contains the factory for user objects and the function to start a set of simulations.</li>
<li><B><A HREF="montecarlo.html">scheduler/montecarlo.h</A></B> contains the classes for Monte Carlo simulations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing a simulation</h3>
Implementing the user class for Monte Carlo simulations is discussed <a href="implementing.html">here</A> using the <A HREF="../../example/scheduler/">Ising model example</A> provided with the library. The directory contains a second example, using the <A href="../lattice/index.html">Lattice</A> library, which is not discussed in detail here.
<h3>Running a simulation</h3>
<a href="running.html">Here</A> we discuss how to run Monte Carlo simulations with the library.

<H2>Tools</H2>
The scheduler library is accompanied by two tools:
<ul> <li><b>convert2xml</b> is a program to convert legacy files from older releases of the Alea library to the new XML format and can be used as a template for conversion tools for the file formats of other users.</li>
<li><b>compactrun</b> is a program which takes a checkpoint file of a Monte Carlo run and strips off all the simulation specific data, keeping only the simulation results.
</ul>
The usage of both tools is explained with the <a href="running.html">example program</a>.
<H2>Examples</H2>

To build the examples go to the <tt>example/scheduler</tt> subdirectory of ALPS directory and type
<blockquote><pre>
make all
</blockquote></pre>
The source code and  of the examples is well documented and self-explanatory.

<P>To run the examples type see <a href="running.html">here</a>.
