      This License applies to any software containing a notice placed by the copyright
      holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of the ALPS Library
      License version 1.1. Such software is herein referred to as the "Library".
      This license grants permission to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute
      and transmit the Library, and to prepare derivative works of the Library, and
      to permit others to do so for non-commercial academic use, all subject to the
      following conditions:

<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
          In any scientific publication based wholly or in part on the Library, the
          use of the Library must be acknowledged and the publications listed in
          the accompanying CITATIONS.txt document must be cited.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library in the form
          that you received it, as long as all copyright notices and references to
          this license and warranty disclaimer are kept intact, and all recipients
          also receive a copy of this license, warranty disclaimer and CITATIONS.txt
          document.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          You may modify your copy or copies of the Library, thus forming a work
          based on the Library, and use, copy or distribute such modified works under
          the terms of sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you also meet all of
          these conditions:
          <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem">
                You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

<li class="listitem">
                All citations listed in the CITATIONS.txt document that refer to

                You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
                or in part contains or is derived from the Library or any part thereof,
                to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under

          This Software, or modifications under section 3 above, may be distributed
          in object code or executable form, provided that you meet all of these
          conditions:
          <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">

                This complete License, warranty disclaimer and accompanying CITATIONS.txt

<li class="listitem">
                The executable program is accompanied with the complete machine-readable
                source code to the Library as used in the executable, which must
                be distributed under the terms of sections 2 and 3 above. Alternatively,
                you may provide instructions for obtaining the source code at no
                cost (for example, a hyper-text link).
              </li>
</ol></div>
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
          is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
          is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
          scope of this License.<br> However, linking such a work with the Library
          creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
          portions of the Library). The executable is therefore covered by this License.
          Section 4 states terms for distribution of such executables.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          You must cause executable programs that utilize this Library to print or
          display, when started in the most basic way, a prominent announcement including
          a copyright notice and citation requirements as listed in the accompanying
          CITATIONS.txt document. If the executable program utilizes the Library
          in a modified form (under section 3 above), then the announcement must
          state this. Exception: if the announcement would not normally be visible
          to the user, or the announcement would interfere with normal operations
          of the executable application, then the executable program is not required
          to print an announcement.
