ALPS Project

The ALPS project (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations)
aims at providing generic parallel algorithms for classical and
quantum lattice models and provides utility classes and algorithm for
many other problems. It strives to increase software reuse in the
physics community.

This is the "ALPS Light" Libraries, public-domain part of the ALPS
Libraries. If you need the full functionality of the ALPS Libraries,
such as Lattice, Model, Scheduler, etc, please use the full version of
ALPS Libraries, which is available from http://alps.comp-phys.org/.
See doc/index-light.html for more details.
